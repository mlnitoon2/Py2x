## Py2x

A server-side reimplementation of **SmartFoxServer 2X**, designed to provide a similar environment and functionality while offering greater flexibility and compatibility for custom modifications and integrations.

### Key Features:

* **Custom Server Logic**: Py2x aims to replicate the server-side features of SmartFoxServer 2X with added flexibility for custom game logic and server-side actions.
* **Integration Support**: Provides seamless integration with external tools, custom scripts, and third-party applications.
* **Event Handling**: Robust event handling system allowing easy creation of event listeners for user actions, game state changes, and server events.
* **Session Management**: Manages user sessions efficiently with easy-to-use API methods for tracking, modifying, and authenticating player sessions.

### External Libraries:

* **[PyFox2x](https://github.com/MSM-Hacks/PyFox2x)**: A Python-based library that provides the SFSObject and SFSArray classes, along with packet code needed to communicate with the SmartFoxServer. These classes handle the encoding, decoding, and management of data packets sent between the client and server.
